# GithubSearch - POC

This is a POC project to read data from Github API

In this project I`ll be using

* Kotlin
* RxJava RxAndroid
* Retrofit2 with Gson

And I`ll implement a *MVP* pattern

As of now, the base is structure is well implemented, there are some information on UI missing, and some Good layouts to make it more user friendly

Next step:

* Add Mockito to dependencies
* Create unit tests for presenters
